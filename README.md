# Impacts of assembly resolution on copy number detection and population structure estimates

### Lucia Bazan-Williamson - University of California Merced, School of Natural Sciences

Summary: Copy number variants (CNVs) are a crucial aspect of human
genomic diversity. CNVs can drive phenotypic variation, affect disease suscep-
tibility, and are a key driver of population diversity. New methods for genomic
data generation and assembly are providing highly accurate maps of copy number
variation, yielding opportunities to ascertain variation at full resolution. These
data, in turn, have the potential to shape inferences from variation in human
populations, such as inferences about demographic history. In this study, we
compared CNV variation in a classic and widely used human genome assembly,
GRCh37, with CNVs detected using a new, high resolution human genome assem-
bly, T2TCHM13 to characterize their differences, and their impact on inferences
about a key aspect of human variability, population structure. We found major differences in estimates of CNV abundance, allele counts, frequency distributions, and population differentiation between
T2TCHM13 and the older GRCh37 assembly. In particular, the T2T-CHM13
assembly harbored more than 20 times the number of CNV loci found in GRCh37,
as well as higher copy numbers, and many novel duplications, which were enriched
in telomeric regions.
